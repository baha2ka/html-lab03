  <h3> Welcom to our website </h3>
      <p> *It’s nearly impossible to exist as a restaurant in 2021 without some sort of web presence, and restaurant review sites are a big part of that online presence. Even if you haven’t invested in designing a restaurant website of your own, that doesn’t stop customers from reviewing your restaurant and sharing their own experiences. The internet has broadened horizons for word of mouth. It’s given people new ways of gauging social proof and deciding where to eat for any given time, place and occasion.Survey data shows that 94% of U.S. diners are influenced by online reviews — especially when they’re on the hunt for somewhere new to eat out. The more positive experiences listed, the better, in addition to boasting well-curated photos and menu information.Reviews aside, however, owning a presence online is also crucial for a restaurant’s discoverability. To continue fueling foot traffic and online reviews, people need to know that you exist.Reviews aside, however, owning a presence online is also crucial for a restaurant’s discoverability.
